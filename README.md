## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS, and a 1st attempt at flexbox


### What I learned and some useful resources

For this challenge I tried my hand at flexbox, and using a media query to change from horizontal to vertical for mobile. This was particularly tricky for me, and I also tried the html "picture" tag, but couldn't really get it to work the way I wanted. I learned alot, watched a few flexbox tutorials, and spent a lot of time at W3 Schools. Definitely got really frustrated at times, but I'm pretty happy with the outcome, so I'm posting it!


### Continued development

I plan on working more with flexbox and getting more comfortable with it. I"m still not sure I am implementing it right or fully understanding it. Then I'd like to try my hand at Bootstrap.
